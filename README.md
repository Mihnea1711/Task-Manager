# TaskMaster - C# Task Management Project

## Description

TaskMaster is a collaborative project developed for the Programming Engineering course at the university. Inspired by JIRA, it's a lightweight task management tool designed to streamline project organization. The project is built using C# Forms, ensuring a user-friendly experience for all users. TaskMaster adopts a simple Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture to keep things neat and organized. From the beginning, we adhered to strict naming and design conventions, making the code easy to understand and work with. To store task-related information, TaskMaster utilizes a SQLite database, keeping things simple and efficient.
